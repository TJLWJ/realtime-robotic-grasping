# realtime-robotic-grasping

## Overview
This repository is the supplementary materials of the paper "A Novel Camera Fusion Method based on Switching Scheme and object detection For Real Time Robotic Grasping."[Video](https://youtu.be/aFGE-4iL2w8) by Liu et al. In this repo, we provide code about the use of ur5 and Intel D435 for real-time robotic grasping.
